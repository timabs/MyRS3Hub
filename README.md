# MyRS3Hub

Built using ASP.NET Core and Blazor, RS3Hub is a simple webapp to get your Runescape 3 game info in one neat-looking consolidated place. Currently, users can input any public profile username and get back combat level, total combat XP, all their skills levels and XP, an activity log for the last 20 in-game interactions (level ups, quests finished, songs unlocked, etc.), and some quest stats.

Planning to add a 'notebook' feature to track RS specific tasks like quests, skilling locations, etc. I want to leverage more of the Runescape API to attach items needed for tasks, the ability to cross them off, etc. I'd also like to add the Runescape map and the ability to add locations to tasks.
